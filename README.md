# Big-Data-Analysis

This project will import a .soft file formatted dataset.  It will then take all of the individual data sets within the .soft file and load them into a database (Mariadb).  I have also included methods to run statistical analyses on the datasets, and methods to graphically display the results of those analyses using R (rpy2).

Upcoming:

		Using DAKOTA to run various algorithms on the data, such as Uncertainty Quantificaiton.
